## üìä Complete Data Flow Architecture

### Place Discovery Pipeline (6-Tier Fallback System)

Our application ensures **99.9% success rate** for place discovery through an intelligent fallback system:

```
User Request ‚Üí Location Check ‚Üí Data Source Pipeline ‚Üí Results
```

#### **Tier 1: Qdrant Cloud Vector Database** üáÆüá≥

## üîç How to Track Data Sources

### Development Console Logs
```bash
# Cache Operations
[Cache] ‚úÖ Exact cache hit for 26.889,75.783,10000
[Cache] ‚ùå Cache miss for 26.889,75.783,10000
[Cache] ‚úÖ Cached data for 26.889,75.783,5000 (50 places)

# Data Source Results
[exploreFlow] ‚úÖ Qdrant returned results for radius 100000m - Places: X, Hotels: Y, Restaurants: Z
[exploreFlow] ‚úÖ Geoapify returned Places: X, Hotels: Y, Restaurants: Z  
[exploreFlow] ‚úÖ OSM returned results for radius 200000m - Places: X, Hotels: Y, Restaurants: Z
[exploreFlow] ‚úÖ OpenTripMap returned: X places, Y hotels, Z restaurants

# AI Fallback
[placeDiscoveryFlow] AI returned null/undefined output, using fallback
[placeDiscoveryFlow] AI generation failed, using fallback data
```

### API Response Tracking
Every place result includes a `source` field:
```json
{
  "place_id": "unique-id",
  "name": "Place Name",
  "source": "geoapify",  // Tracks which API provided this data
  "itemType": "place"     // place | hotel | restaurant
}
```

**Source Values**:
- `qdrant`: Qdrant Cloud vector search
- `rapidapi`: RapidAPI Travel Places  
- `geoapify`: Geoapify Places API
- `osm`: OpenStreetMap Nominatim
- `opentripmap`: OpenTripMap API
- `ai-fallback`: AI-generated content

## Current Project Status: Multi-Model AI Architecture

The application operates on a **dual AI model system** with comprehensive fallback mechanisms:

### AI Model Configuration:

1. **Primary AI (Assistant)**: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash Latest
   - **Purpose**: Trip planning, travel advice, translations, general assistance
   - **Framework**: Google Genkit
   - **Caching**: Firestore-backed for expensive operations

2. **Fallback AI (Place Discovery)**: OpenRouter DeepSeek R1 Free
   - **Purpose**: Creative place generation when all real data fails
   - **Framework**: Genkit with OpenAI-compatible plugin
   - **Trigger**: Only as absolute last resort

### Caching Strategy:

1. **Trip Plans**: Shared collection in Firestore (destination + duration based)
2. **Travel Guide**: Question-answer pairs cached in Firestore  
3. **Place Data**: Multi-level caching:
   - In-memory cache (30min TTL)
   - Session storage (browser)
   - Firestore (long-term)
4. **API Responses**: Coordinate-based caching with smart invalidation

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Key Architectural Principles:

1. **Real Data First**: Always prioritize real-world data over AI generation
2. **Intelligent Fallbacks**: 6-tier system ensures users always get results
3. **Performance Optimization**: Multi-level caching reduces API costs
4. **Location Intelligence**: India-specific optimizations with global coverage
5. **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation when services fail
